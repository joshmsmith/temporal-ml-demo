# Temporal ML Sentiment Demo
Machine Learning demo using [Temporal](temporal.io) to orchestrate file processing of csv dataset and show sentiment as well as probability for user reviews using inference. Any csv that has a column called ```Reviewer_Location``` and ```Review_Text``` will work. Text should be a review of a product or service. Location should be where the reviewer was located.

The demo implements activity sticky queue in Temporal so that activities run on same worker where the csv file has been uploaded.
